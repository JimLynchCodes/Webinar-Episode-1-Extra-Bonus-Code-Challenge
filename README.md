# Webinar-Episode-1-Extra-Bonus-Code-Challenge

_Assumes you're starting from a project that solves the code challenge from webinar episode 1._

## New Goals

 - Make it so that rather than the users setting their number to ANY number, they can only increment it by 1.

 - Allow contract owner to reset anyone's number back to zero (and only zero).

 - Make the increment function only callable once per day, per user.

 - Give users the ability to mint an ERC20 token and "own" the token.

 - Create a view function that returns ALL tokens on the blockchain and their owner.
